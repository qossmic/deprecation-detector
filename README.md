**CAUTION**: This package is abandoned and will no longer receive any updates.

The SensioLabs DeprecationDetector runs a static code analysis against your project's source code to find usages of deprecated methods, classes and interfaces. For Symfony projects, it also detects usages of deprecated services.
It identifies the use of deprecated code thanks to the `@deprecated` annotation.

### Disclaimer

**Please note this tool is in a very early stage of development. Expect bugs and quirks.** 

## Basic knowledge

The Sensiolabs DeprecationDetector is a command line command based on the [Symfony Console component](https://github.com/symfony/Console).
It makes heavy use of the [PHP-Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) library for analyzing PHP code.  

The command works in three steps:

1. Scanning your vendor libraries for defined deprecations and cache them as a `ruleset`
2. Finding usages of those deprecations from your ruleset.
3. Output with the affected code parts.

## Installation

### Composer

For a system-wide installation via Composer, you can run:

```bash
$ composer global require sensiolabs-de/deprecation-detector
```

Make sure you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` in your `PATH` and you will be able to call the `deprecation-detector` command.

### PHAR

You can download the PHAR file available on the [releases page](https://github.com/sensiolabs-de/deprecation-detector/releases):

```
curl -OL https://github.com/sensiolabs-de/deprecation-detector/releases/download/0.1.0-alpha4/deprecation-detector.phar
php deprecation-detector.phar
```

### Standalone

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sensiolabs-de/deprecation-detector.git
```

Run composer

```bash
$ composer install
```

Create phar archive with [Box](http://box-project.github.io/box2/) (optional)

```bash
$ box build
```

Provided you created the phar archive, if you want to call the deprecation-detector globally, it needs to be placed in your `PATH`. For example with:

```bash
$ chmod a+x deprecation-detector.phar
$ mv deprecation-detector.phar /usr/local/bin/deprecation-detector
```

Otherwise you can call `bin/deprecation-detector` directly.

## Usage


To use the DeprecationDetector you need to provide the `source` and the `ruleset` arguments.
Please note that rulesets are automatically generated for every source argument.

```bash
$ deprecation-detector check src/ vendor/
$ deprecation-detector check src/ composer.lock
$ deprecation-detector check src/ .rules/some_generated_rule_set
```

If you have different source paths you can pass them seperated by a comma.

```bash
$ deprecation-detector check src/,legacy/ vendor/
```

### Output

There are different output formats available, by default the output is printed in the commandline.

#### Html
```bash
$ deprecation-detector check src/ vendor/ --log-html deprecationlog.html
```

You can get a list of all options and arguments by running

```bash
$ deprecation-detector check --help
```

The default output might not fit into the cli. If that is the case you can set the output to a list by setting `--output=simple`.

```bash
$ deprecation-detector check src/ vendor/ --output=simple
```

## Excluding deprecated method calls

You can exclude deprecated method calls by using the `filter-methods` option. This option takes a comma separated list of method references to exclude.

```bash
$ deprecation-detector check --filter-methods=MyClass::method,Foo::bar src/ vendor/
```

This will exclude all deprecated calls to MyClass::method and Foo::bar.
